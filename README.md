# DuckyJS
Ducky written in JavaScript, using Node.js

## Installation

Ducky requires quite a few different libraries to provide all its features. The only one that is required purely for Ducky is Discord.js:

npm install discordjs

Other dependancies for the pre-made command files:

npm install forever
npm install httpreq
npm install js-yaml
npm install mathjs
npm install mt-files-downloader
npm install read-yaml
npm install unirest
npm install write-yaml

They were included at one point, but makes Ducky exceed 3000 files which is hard to constantly download/reupload to ensure all changes are correctly updated.
